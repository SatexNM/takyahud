Floating health is not supported. Add these commands to console/autoexec  
`tf_hud_target_id_alpha 255`  
`tf_hud_target_id_disable_floating_health 1`  

To disable pulsing health bars (low/buffed, navigate to custom/FLV (BLU)/scripts/ and rename HudAnimations_tf-NOPULSE.txt to HudAnimations_tf.txt, overwriting/delete the other.
