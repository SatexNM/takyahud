    //Colors & optional elements
    Your first stop for customizing this HUD will be the clientscheme. 
    You can find it in custom/hudname/resource.
    .res files can be opened with text editors such as Notepad++. 

    You can change colors and enable/disable certain elements.
    Instructions are in the clientscheme itself.
	
    //Main Menu
    You can enter your name for the main menu in 
    /resource/ui/MainMenuOverride.res

    The bottom right star button can connect you to your favourite server.
    You'll need to add...
   
    alias Home "connect <insert server IP>;password <insert password>"
    
    ...to your autoexec in order to make the "Home Server" button work.

    //Crosshairs
    To enable HUD-crosshair navigate to /scripts/hudlayou.res
    First you'll need to locate the crosshair that you want to enable.
    Then you can set its visible value to "1" to enable it.
    
    The crosshair.png image gives you an overview of the new crosshairs 
    (they're still WIP).
    The letter in the "labeltext" entry is used to select your crosshair. 
    You can change its color & the on-hit flash color in the clientscheme.
    
    All previous crosshairs are still part of the HUD. 
    This includes fog's, Garm3n's & konr's crosshairs.
